"use strict";

/* "use strict" is a literal expression that indictes 
 * that the code shoudl be executed in "strict mode".
 * 
 * Strict mode makess it easier to write "secure" javacript,
 * strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into 
 * real errors.
 * 
 * For example, mistyping a variable name creates a new
 * glabal variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error,
 * making it impossible to accidently create a global varibale.
 * 
 * this should be used at the top of the script file.
