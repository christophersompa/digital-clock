//                       Maths and Numbers Syntax

// We write it down like normal math e.g. 9 + 1, 4 * 2, 8 / 2 and 5 - 3 

// The order of operation * & / are done first and + & - are done after. This is called operator precedence.

// If you have 2 * 3 / 2 - it would calculate left to right.

// We can use brackets to control which gets done first (1 + 1) * 3 = 6

// Brackets have the highest priority in operator precedence
